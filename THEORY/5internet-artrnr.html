      <h2>Internet-Art - Rationale & Reflection</h2>
    </header>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      My internet art is based off the advancement in terms of style that
      internet and more specifically its webpages undertook. The artwork starts
      off as a normal, barebones HTML page, mirroring the first ever webpage.
      The user than has the opportunity to use the provided to buttons, to
      change various aspects of the page such as color and font.
    </p>
    <h3>Rationale</h3>
    <p>
      By clicking on the buttons, the user is effectively skipping years of
      internet evolution with a simple click of a button. The button clicks show
      the relation as well as the transformation between the first ever webpage,
      and the modern-day internet. I have linked the notorious ‘first ever
      webpage’ to guide the user in the same direction that I was when I first
      got this idea. It’s a very <em>“That’s the first webpage!”</em> line of
      thought, which I believe (hope) will spark some introspection in the user.
      The internet is just another tool for us today, but to only view it as
      such, is to disregard the artistic elements of it. When I watched the
      first lecture, which I believe was titled “net/web art”, my brain kept
      autocorrecting it to “web/art”. Now maybe this is a bit of a stretch, but
      web/art makes a lot of sense. The web is (not always, but in more ways
      than we sometimes realize) art.
    </p>
    <h3>Critical Reflection</h3>
    <p>
      This is the part where I rip myself to shreds before you can. Dracula told
      Igor: “Do unto others before they do unto you” (from the crappy, so bad
      its good movie Van Helsing) but I guess in this case its “Do unto you
      before others do.” Let’s begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let’s begin with the good. The artwork, I believe shows the core message
      that I tried to portray. Of the few people that I showed it to, all had
      the same reaction, (with varying degrees of interest – my dad's more of a
      newspaper guy) of <em>“That’s what it looked like?”</em> I believe in that
      regard the artwork is effective in eliciting that response, and perhaps
      sparking that introspection I spoke of earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, I do realize, that with an idea like this I could do a lot more
      aesthetically speaking. My only drawbacks were technical prowess, and
      time. However, as the brief states a “small scale Internet Artwork” I
      believe this artwork is still effective. The changes that the buttons
      bring to the website, while not the flashiest, are flashy enough by
      comparison that the effect is achieved. Granted, it only takes a bit of
      CSS tweaking to be flashier than an HTML doc, but that’s the whole point.
