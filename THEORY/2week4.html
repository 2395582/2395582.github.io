      APIs posed quite a problem to me last year, and I look forward to getting
      more practice so I can reach a point where the mention of APIs do not
      induce a deep and long-lasting trauma. Wish me luck.

      In Mailloux’s (?) paper on convention he states an interesting notion
      which grabbed me. The unconventional, if accepted by the community,
      becomes convention. (First they hate, then they imitate). There is no
      denying that anything against convention in any practice would first be
      questioned, and/or scorned, but it also has the potential to inculcate
      itself into that practice. But before we can find out if something will
      become convention, we are shocked by it. And if its got staying power…
    </p>
    <p>
      This I believe leaves two paths for artists and designers, or indeed any
      hoping to add in some way to a craft. The conventional path. Its safe,
      tried and tested. You know how it works, your audience knows how it works,
      and its easy to keep everyone on the same page. At first glance it may
      seem… too safe. Boring perhaps. Risk free and thus minimal rewards. But in
      some contexts this is exactly what you want. In some contexts; if we don’t
      do things the way they supposed to be done, how can we expect things to
      come out the way we want.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why do we progress when we shouldn’t? Because its sometimes a chance that
      has to be taken. Sometimes we must step out of the circle the fire creates
      and venture into the dark unknown. Some would say, this is exactly what an
      artist does. Step into the unknown and bring out some treasures for the
      rest of the people. The people would, naturally, react with shock to
      unknown, but if what the artist has said has staying power, it will remain
      with them indefinitely. Like Bill Withers said/sang; “The words that say
      the most, say things that last.”
    </p>
    <p>
      What I took from this (besides the ramblings seen above) was that in this
      task there is an element of both these paths. On a technical level when,
      when creating web art, one would do well to follow conventions in the
      construction of the website. HTML never changes, CSS always looks like CSS
      and JavaScript is a bitch. No real room for shocks.
