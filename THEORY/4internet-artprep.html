      <h2>Internet-Art - Preparation</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
      The preparation of this art project began firstly, with a familiarization
      of Internet Art as an artform. I perused the various examples with as open
      a mind as I could muster, (which is pretty open considering the degree
      I’ve dedicated almost four years to now) and… Internet Art is interesting.
      There seem to be almost no rules, except that the artwork be
      <em>of</em> the internet.
    </p>
    <p>
      An artwork created using the internet as a tool that is. In this digital
      craft, the internet is to the artwork, what a paint brush is to a
      painting. Or a chisel to a sculptor. Or Robert De Niro to Martin Scorsese.
      The artwork has to be dependent on the internet.
    </p>
    <p>
      All my musings in these early stages revolved, naturally around the
      internet. It was a tool I used every day, but never to make art. As I
      continued to think about the internet, browsing both for business and
      pleasure, simultaneously doing research on internet art, as well as
      checking out the style used on websites, a thought occurred to me. Not
      exactly a “Eureka!” moment, but the beginnings of one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where did the Internet start? And more importantly for my purposes, how
      did look it when it started? That line of thought quickly lead me to
      <a href=" http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html"
        >The Project</a
      >
      which is the genesis of the World Wide Web as we know it. And there it
      was. In black and white. And blue. (Great color palate, right?) I found it
      so strange to think, that over the years we’ve gone from that to the
      websites we see today. Just a little bit of style. A little bit of style
      that went a long way.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that is how I came to the decision of creating a website that
      celebrated that progression. “Progress” was actually the original name of
      this website. But, in keeping with my attempts to have a modern aesthetic,
      I decided on “THRIVE”. All caps and bold. Just the type of word you’d see
      slapped on to a mass-produced T-Shirt and sold in clothing stores the
      world over. (Next to a T-shirt that says “SLAY” which I think is a dragons
      and dungeons reference). “THRIVE.” Very modern. <em>Hip</em>, I should
      say? (No, no probably not)
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the more practical preparation, I browsed the websites from
      previous years, for inspiration. I quite like the idea here
      <a href="https://iman345.github.io/imanreact/">Iman's Corner</a> where the
      user was given control over the artwork. User-controlled works of art are
      a common theme in this, my game design degree, so the idea really grabbed
      my attention. Following this line of thought, is what got me to where I am
      now.
    </p>
    <p>
      The technical work that went into this was fairly simple. As per the brief
      I relied heavily on HTML and CSS, only using JS where necessary. In order
      for the artwork to work, I had to find various example of different color
      combinations which I could use. I found them here
      <a
        href="https://digitalsynopsis.com/design/color-palettes-schemes-combos-inspiration/"
        >Digital Synopsis</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      All in all, I think the artwork, though deceptively simple worked. But
      more on that in the reflection.
