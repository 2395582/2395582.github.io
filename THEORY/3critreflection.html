      <h2>Critical Reflection on UI & UX</h2>
    </header>
    <h3>Clarity & Familiarity</h3>
    <p>
      There is clear and consistent communication with the user, setting up
      expectations of behavior. Every page is labeled, and links are
      consistently provided to allow the user to navigate the website with ease.
    </p>
    <h3>Control & Navigation</h3>
    <p>
      Pages are titled and the elements which control navigation are visually
      responsive. Links highlight when hovered, as do buttons. Through styling,
      these responses are heightened and thus provide increased control to the
      user. Which can be used to navigate the website with ease.
    </p>
    <h3>Information Hierarchy</h3>
    <p>
      The page layout takes advantage of negative space, and consolidates the
      content in certain sections of the screen. The negative space reinforces.
      The colors used are highly contrasting making text legible. Info hierarchy
      is created with the used of varying font sizes for headings, subheadings,
      and main content.
    </p>
    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
    <p>
      The color contrast, font, font size, and negative space all create a
      reading experience which is streamlined and simple. The color of the font
      is visible on the contrasting background. The size is neither too big, nor
      too small, and thus can be read with ease. Negative space consolidates the
      main content in a section (usually the center) of the screen, which again
      is easy on the eyes. The document is structured logically. There is
      equivalent alternative text supplied for all images, and semantic markup
      is good.
