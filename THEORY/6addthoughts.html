      “There seem to be almost no rules, except that the artwork be of the
      internet.”
    </p>
    <p>
      This is an interesting caveat for an artwork. Every art form, and
      subsequently every work of art, is limited in a similar way. Movies are
      shot on a camera. Books are written. In order to categorize an artwork,
      the rule is that it must be dependent on certain tools to be made. To be
      made in any way the artist sees fit yes, but made with those tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      Internet art, has to be dependent on the internet. Definitions for
      internet art can be hard to come by, so as a rule I apply the statement
      “Would this be possible if the internet never existed?”. Not a very hard
      and fast rule, but that’s the point I’m getting to. (Slowly but surely)
    </p>
    <p>
      The internet is a World Wide Wonderland with almost infinite
      possibilities. As full of potential as a blank page.
    </p>
    <p>
      The internet is also the tool that must be used to create Internet Art.
      (See where I’m going with this?)
    </p>
    <p>
      What happens when the tool used in the creation of art, is able to do
      almost everything? Well, you should know since you’ve been marking my
      peer’s work for the past few minutes/hours/days. (If it's days, do take a
      rest, even a smoke break will do)My answer is: You’ll get art that
      realizes as much potential as the artist wanted to realize for their
      needs. The internet can do anything, but all it needs to do is what I want
      it to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is why, I think, all the internet art I perused in my research were
      so confusing to me. The limitless potential lead to limitless creation and
      the results were very difficult to group together. While at the time, I
      admit I wrote it off as artsy BS, I believe I’ve followed a line of logic
      that has allowed me to reason with it. (Yes, because that's what art
      needs, logic and reason.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Internet Art is <em>uncategorizable</em> , because the internet is
      <em>uncategorizable</em>. An extreme statement I know, lacking some
      nuance, but it’s a fitting addition to my musings. Extreme, and lacking
      some nuance.
