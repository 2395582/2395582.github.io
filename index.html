          <p>
            The movie industry is a multi-billion dollar dream machine. Decades
            of work projected on to the silver screen to entertain audiences...
            and make money.
          </p>
          <p>
            While the notion that art is not made with the intention of filling
            bank accounts is a very romantic one, it is undeniable that the
            lining of pockets is an important by-product of this industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            And while, I'll be the first to admit that a large box office does
            not always indicate a good film, the money does tend to come into
            play.
          </p>
          <p>
            So join me, and take a look at the highest earning movies of each
            decade, starting from the roaring Twenties and ending with the
            spandex clad summer blockbusters of today.

            The data provided will display the three highest grossing movies of
            each decade, in the past century. Naturally, due to inflation,
            differences will be blown a bit out of proportion, but some
            information can be garnered from these graphs.

            Information such as the “genre shift” humanity has taken over the
            past 100 years. Where cowboys and gunslingers once reigned supreme,
            now stand men in tights. Cultural fixations reflected in movies over
            the decades will become apparent with the information of which
            movies were most popular with which audiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            The data on the stories we loved, will tell us stories of their own.
