    <h3>Goal and Aesthetic</h3>
    <p>
      My goal was to show the visual progress of the internet, my aesthetic
      across the website was tied into this i.e. either old aesthetic or new.
    </p>
    <h3>Visual Design Elements</h3>
    <p>
      Line – the webpages are filled with straight lines, whether visible (nav
      bar) or abstract (between text). This gives the page structure, and keeps
      it neat and orderly looking; which is very important for my modern
      (minimalistic) aesthetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shape – In keeping with this minimalistic aesthetic, the shapes are sharp
      and blocky. These pristine edges are very closely related to my aesthetic.
      The font as well is blocky, but without being sharp and harsh. Instead it
      appears bold.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only exception to the square shapes, is the buttons in the control
      panel, which were styled to look like buttons on a remote control.
    </p>
    <p>
      Space – My information, and points of interest are laid out in the center
      of the page. This (usually) leaves some negative space on either side,
      which guides the user along the center of the page. Again, the exception
      lies with the control panel, which is placed on the <em>right</em>, as
      most users will be used to focusing their vision on the
      <em>left</em> (with game menus and even some websites). This leaves them
      free to <em>play</em> with the remote, but <em>focus</em> on the content.
    </p>
    <p>
      Color – The yellow color is strong and bright, intensely contrasting with
      the vivid black. The juxtaposition between light and dark is very visually
      striking, and appealing (I hope).
    </p>
    <p>
      Texture – there is a single example of texture on this website, and once
      again it lies in the exception of the (exceptional) control panel. The
      buttons are styled to look and feel like a button. When interacted with,
      the effect coupled with the tapping of a track pad, or clicking of a mouse
      button is very satisfying.
    </p>
    <h3>Justification of Significant Design Decisions (Features Not Bugs)</h3>
    <p>I will go through these starting from the top of the page.</p>
    <p>
      There is a space above the navigation bar. This is intentional as I enjoy
      the visual appeal of it. It gives the nav bar that stripey look/feel which
      I believe adds the to the modern aesthetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes the links might seem difficult to see against the background.
      Before fixing this, I looked at the effect that this had. When looking at
      a link that was difficult to see against the background (white on yellow)
      I realized that the hover effect became useful, not only in highlighting
      the link, but effectively filling up what could previously be assumed to
      be negative space (with subtle hints to suggest otherwise). This zoned me
      into that link.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the blogs, I have really tightened the content into the center of the
      page, to make reading the blogs easier. The negative space controls the
      vision I guess.
