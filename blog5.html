      <h1>My Data Driven Artwork - Critical Reflection</h1>
      <p>
        The data driven artwork I have decided to use for my site, will take the
        form of a ‘Word Cloud’. Herein I will explain my reasoning behind this
        decision, as well what as what actually constitutes a word cloud, and
        why exactly that constitutes art.
      </p>
      <p class="sub">DATA ART</p>
      <p class="quote">
        “…artistic visualizations are visualizations of data done by artists
        with the intent of making art.”
      </p>
      <p>(Viégas, et al. 2007, p.2)</p>
      <p>
        First and foremost, perhaps an understanding of what Data Art actually
        is, should be shown. The above quote succinctly brings us to such an
        understanding. Data art, must therefore rely on data, and visualize that
        data with the intent of producing art. This is not art produced as a
        by-product of data visualization. It is art produced through data viz
        with the deliberate intention of creating art. All this is, naturally,
        performed by an artist. Or one perpetrating as such.
      </p>
      <p>
        The quoted paper goes on to state that the artworks rendered must be
        based on actual data. (Viégas, et al. 2007, p.) It is, after all, data
        driven artwork. Any decisions made by the artist, which detract from the
        data, and rely on, highly artistic perhaps, superficial visualizations
        will therefore stray from the category of data art.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another point the paper brings up is one of beauty. To summarise their
        point: beauty does not necessarily constitute art, and art does not
        necessarily have to be beautiful. This ties in with intent. A scientific
        visualization, which may be beautiful, cannot constitute art as the
        intention for art was not present at its genesis.
      </p>

      <p class="sub">WORD CLOUD</p>
      <p>
        A word cloud refers to visual representation of (word) data. It appears
        in the form of a cluster of words, of varying size and boldness. An
        example:
      </p>
      <img
        src="Images/cloud.webp"
        alt="Example of a word cloud"
        class="cloud"
      />

      <p>
        The choice of words, in a data art context, is obviously not arbitrary.
        It is often used to portray data such as the most common passwords, or
        most common names, with the number one most common being the thickest
        and biggest word in the cloud.
      </p>
      <p>
        This again, is not arbitrary. The varying weight and size of the font,
        depend on its importance, or rank in the data. Words of higher
        importance or of a higher rank in the data set are given more space
        worthy of their ‘status’ in the ‘word hierarchy’. This naturally leads
        to resentment amongst the smaller words, which often leads to bloody
        revolution in an attempt to overthrow the… no, wait that’s a different
        story.
      </p>
      <p>
        How exactly this constitutes data art, is due, as previously discussed,
        to the intention. It is also heavily featured on data art websites and
        while it may not be the most visually impressive, I find it to be quite
        arresting and also effective for my purposes.
      </p>
      <p class="sub">HEAD IN THE WORD CLOUD</p>
      <p>
        The reason I am choosing a word cloud visualization for my data driven
        artwork, is because as well as being able to represent my data, it will
        also be interactive and provide some benefit to the user.
      </p>
      <p>
        The data my word cloud represents is the titles of the 250 best movies
        as per IMDb. The ‘words’ will be the titles of each movie, ordered
        according to the position they appear in the list. The bigger and bolder
        the title, the higher the movie is on the list. I believe this is
        effective as the user will easily be able to determine the importance of
        the film in relation to the size of its title. This will give them a
        quick breakdown of the cinematic standings of these films, at a glance.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is also, the inexplicable allure of a cluster of recognizable
        entities, grouped almost randomly, in a way that is almost
        counterproductive to actually perusing these entities. It is the same
        principles in play with collages, and those superhero wallpapers
        featuring a large number of recognizable characters. The users eyes are
        torn, between being drawn to the largest and therefore most impressive
        entity (as per the principles of information hierarchies) and being
        drawn to the most recognizable.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for the second reason, the interactivity I hope to offer the user,
        each word in the cloud will be a clickable link which will lead to the
        google page of the movie.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this way, users will not only be able to see which movies are the
        best as per the list, but can also immediately find out more about the
        movie, in an attempt to determine whether or not they would want to
        watch it. I considered placing a link to a site where users could
        purchase the movie, but people don’t really buy movies anymore. (Aaarghh
        maties)
      </p>
      <p>
        This data driven artwork, as per the definition of offered, is indeed a
        data driven artwork. Made with the intention of art, using data in a way
        that would not be regarded as superficial, and made by an artist (or one
        perpetrating as such at least). I believe it is effective in rounding
        out the website, as it will achieve a core intention of the site; to
        drive people to watch, or at least show interest in, movies which can be
        hailed as great works of art. It is, in essence, a work of art,
        celebrating works of art.
      </p>
      <p>
        That is not to say that word cloud are without fault. They have been
        highly criticized in two regards, concerning accuracy on both accounts.
        ‘Readers struggle to translate word size to an accurate frequency’ is
        one of the criticisms. ‘Longer words create a bias, being made up of
        more letters, and thus taking more space’ is another.
      </p>
      <p>
        While this may be true if data sets are solely represented through word
        cloud, I believe that a word cloud as an appendage to a website that
        already features other data viz in the form of bar graphs is an
        effective and even welcome supplement to the more tedious appearing data
        viz on the site. The effect is yet to be seen.
