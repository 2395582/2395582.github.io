    <h1>Critical Reflection</h1>
    <p>
        My website is made to be quite easily explored. Without the main content, the data visualizations, it is hard to judge, but I believe in terms of UI/UX there is a solid foundation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each page follows the same visual pattern to ensure stability across the website, but the content is distinctly different to ensure there is no confusion. I do believe more can be done on this front, to ensure that viewers know exactly what page they are on at all times.
    </p>
    <p>
        The pages all come equipped with a navigation bar offering the links to the different pages on the site. This allows for easy access and navigation across the website. In future, I plan to implement a drop-down menu to offer traversal to each specific page within a page. For example, hovering over the ‘BLOGS’ link on the home page, will allow the viewer to peruse all blogs and choose which one they would like to read. 
    </p>
      <p>
        Aesthetically speaking, the website takes a minimalistic approach. There is sparse use of color and the only decoration comes in the form of a ‘film strip’. This I hoped would add to the visual appeal in keeping with the theme. The images are small enough so as not to be distracting, but also add bit of a break from the rest of the page.
      </p>
      <p>
        The individual blog pages are laid out very simply, with only the text on a white background. This is to ensure no distraction while reading the blogs.
