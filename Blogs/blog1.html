    <h1>Overview of Data Visualization – A Close Reading</h1>
    <p>
      The reading opens with a brief history of data visualization. Through this it
      succeeds in informing the reader of the long-standing use of data
      visualization, as well as the importance and continued relevance of this
      ancient means of information representation. It also establishes that in this
      chapter, and subsequent chapters throughout the book, ‘traditional data
      visualization’ refers to data visualization that focuses on “communication for
      understanding” (Li, 2020, p. 17).
    </p>
    <p>
      Traditional data visualization, according to Li, has a number of advantages.
      After going through the four advantages listed, a conclusion can be drawn,
      that data visualization deals with the representation of data in an attempt to
      identify trends. These trends subsequently allow us to make informed
      hypothesis based on the patterns that emerged.
    </p>
    <p>
      This alone, is ample proof of the usefulness of data visualization. Informed
      guesses about the future, based on past events, seems like a particularly
      smart way to move forward. This does not only highlight the usefulness of data
      visualization, but also reminds us of the importance of correct data
      visualization. The fact that in any given field, quite a lot can be riding on
      the hypothesis made from the data, bolsters the idea that data visualization
      and the principles which govern good data visualization are of utmost
      importance. Informed guesses cannot be made without information. Before
      delving into these principles, the reading first establishes a sound
      definition of data visualization.
    </p>
    <p>
      The definitions surrounding data visualization focus on the relationship
      between data and computer technology, in order to transform data into a visual
      form. The reading quotes Card, Mackinlay and Schneiderman (1999) as defining
      data visualization as:
    </p>
    <p>
      the use of computer-supported, interactive, visual representations of data to
      amplify cognition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another definition quoted in the reading, by Kirk (2012), reads as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      the representation and presentation of data that exploits our visual
      perception abilities in order to amplify cognition
    </p>
    <p>
      These and other definitions given in the reading are quite useful in reaching
      an understanding of the topic, data visualization. The words that ring
      particularly true are ‘exploit’ and ‘amplify’. Given the understanding we’ve
      reached of the importance of data visualization, we can see why these words of
      a rather extreme nature are used in its definition. The data being portrayed
      is of such importance, that its portrayal not only lends itself to our visual
      perceptions, but exploits it, in an attempt to not only achieve cognition, but
      to amplify it. It speaks of a higher understanding born of an exploitation of
      the visual senses. An “information exchange that includes the messenger, the
      receiver and the message” (Kirk, 2012), all which, are of utmost importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      After reaching the definition, the reading goes on to touch on software and
      applications used in the modern-day portrayal of data visualization, as well
      as the core tenets of said programs. It also brings about a distinction
      between two sub-categories within data visualization, information, and
      scientific visualization.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reading then goes into another definition, rather two definitions of
      ‘data’ and ‘information.’ Beginning with data, it defines data as “raw,
      unprocessed information that is not recognised as having any meaning.” (Li,
      2020, p.20). Through the lending of other definitions, the reading pushes the
      idea that data merely exists, in various states, and can be usable or not, and
      is also something we take a rapid influx of on a regular basis (depending on
      your internet speed, I guess) in our current information society.
    </p>
    <p>
      Data is also split into two sub-categories, namely primary and (no prizes for
      guessing) secondary. If the data collected is directly for the purpose of the
      perusal of its information, it is classified as primary data (Agarwal, 2006).
      Data which is processed and analysed in a statistical sense to extract
      information is defined as secondary data. The sub-categories seem to exist
      based on the use of the data, not the data itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Data in this reading, however, is defined as it is similarly defined in
      computer and information sciences as ‘unprocessed information.’ It can
      therefore be both primary and secondary data, and in keeping with the
      aforementioned sciences can be manipulated in several ways, all in an attempt
      to exploit and amplify (see definitions section).
    </p>
    <p>
      Information on the other hand, is the all-purpose flour to the wheat of data,
      that it, it is data after it has undergone some form of processing in order to
      make it readable, understandable, and recognizable based on relational
      connections.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reading then goes on to list a number of traditional forms that data
      visualization can take. The main take away from this section is the idea that
      data visualization, as suggested by its name, depends heavily on the way it is
      represented on a visual level. With the understanding we’ve reached of the
      importance of data visualization, it comes as no surprise that the way the
      data is represented is of equal importance to the data itself. Out of these
      many forms, one should not pick any form arbitrarily, but instead great care
      should be taken to present the data in the best possible way in order to (say
      it with me now) exploit and amplify.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this section, the reading also defines the characteristics of traditional
      data visualization, as; Readability, i.e., it is intelligible and easily
      understood, Recognizability, a characteristic which relies on relational
      connections and deductions made based on previously absorbed information, and
      lastly Meaning, i.e., the information that is portrayed should be understood
      and signify some meaning to the viewer. In providing these characteristics,
      the reading also provides a sort of checklist for would-be data visualizers,
      in order to make sure that their data visualizations meet the necessarily and
      understandably high standards for data visualization.

    <p>
      In the conclusion, the reading drives home the fact that the relationship
      between aesthetics and data visualization is a relationship to be considered.
      The inclusion of aesthetic design principles in data visualization is by no
      means an arbitrary one. Rather it is a decision which further highlights the
      importance of data visualization and bolsters the idea of just how much can
      depend on its existence and the correct portrayal of its existence. It is not
      the addition of flowers in the garden to appease the neighbours, but rather
      the inclusion of aesthetics to enhance the ability of data visualization to
      (one last time) exploit and amplify.
