      <h1>Styleguide</h1>

      <p>
        Below is the first iteration of my wireframe, followed by more recent
        ones.
      </p>
      <img src="Images/wireframe.png" alt="My First Wireframe" class="one" />
      <img
        src="Images/wireframe2.png"
        alt="Wireframe - Second Iteration"
        class="one"
      />
      <img
        src="Images/wireframe3.png"
        alt="Wireframe - Second Iteration"
        class="one"
      />
      <p>
        In the second wireframe, as you can see, I have removed the filmstrip. I
        have numbered the elements I would like to speak about.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the third wireframe, I have added the background image, as a colour
        (black). This is an indication of the change.
      </p>
      <p>
        At position 1, is the logo. This is the name for the site, displayed in
        the largest font size on any given page. This serves as a constant
        reminder of the sites name, and content.
      </p>
      <p>
        At position 2, the links in the top nav bar. This provided linkage
        between all pages on the site. As I have mentioned, these links will
        change on hover. The font size is smaller than the logo, but remains big
        enough to be seen. The white color on the red background gives the links
        and the logo, a popping effect. Users will be able to differentiate
        between logo and links due to the size difference, and the fact that
        links turn black on hover. The black color remains visible, so the link
        does not dissapear, on hover.
      </p>
      <p>
        At 7, is the page title, telling the user which page of the site they
        are on.
      </p>
      <p>
        At 3, is the introductory text, informing the user on what can be found
        on this page.
      </p>
      <p>
        At 4, in the center of the page, both horizontally and vertically, is
        nested the main content. This makes it easy to navigate to. In the case
        of the main content being links, the links are bold and change color on
        hover, using the inverse of the colors used in the nav bar. If the main
        content is text, the text is alligned along the center, again to
        streamline the reading process.
      </p>
      <p>
        5 is the back to top button, providing easy navigation, particularly on
        text heavy pages such as this one. The button floats, and moves with the
        screen, so the user can return at any time, not just when they reach the
        end.
      </p>
      <p>
        6 is the footer bar, along with the links to the pages. Had I been
        inclined to share social media information, I would've added it here.
        The extra links give more oppurtunities for navigation should the user
        require it.
      </p>
      <p>Below is the design of my graph.</p>
      <img src="Images/graphs.png" alt="A rendering of my graph" class="one" />
      <p>
        I split each of the three graphs on seperate pages. I did this, to
        create an effect of the story unfolding across each graph.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each graph became more complex with the increase in sample size changing
        the results accordingly. I think the story the data tells is a good one.
        Its an indicator of which decade has made the MOST best movies, with
        surprising reults. Also with some simple maths, users can find out the
        percentages of the data, leading to statements like the one I had on my
        last graph.
      </p>
      <p>
        The splitting of the graphs onto three different pages was also done in
        an attempt to avoid bombarding the user with too much info. By chunking
        it, so to speak, I was able to get the user acclimatised to the data
        sets, and thus get better understanding and appreciation for the final
        results.
      </p>
