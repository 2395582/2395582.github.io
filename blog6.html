        Data Visualization, Data Art, and their Strategies of Representation.
      </h1>
      <p>
        In this blog, we take a deep dive into the relationship between Data
        Visualization and Data Art, as well as looking into the strategies
        employed by these concepts in terms of representation. Having
        unnecessarily broken down my title (in an attempt to bolster my word
        count – sue me) it now occurs to me that an understanding of these two
        concepts needs to be reached in order to draw up a conception of the
        relationship they share.

        An overview of Li’s Overview of Data Visualization (2020), is already
        available in another blog, but it is the best place to look in our
        attempt to reach an understanding of Data Visualization. This is due to
        the fact that it gives several definitions from several scholars, which
        make the definition as clear and understandable as possible. One such
        definition, a personal favorite is Kirk’s (as quoted by Li).
      </p>
      <p class="quote">
        (Data Visualization is…) the representation and presentation of data
        that exploits our visual perception abilities in order to amplify
        cognition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Herein we find two things of note; a definition of data visualization,
        and an allusion as to how data visualization works. While the ‘how’ of
        the matter has only been loosely stated, a closer reading (so to speak)
        will inform us further.
      </p>
      <p>
        The representation and presentation of data, refers to the fact that
        data vis deals with the portrayal of data, that is information. This
        data is portrayed in a visual form, (in this context achieved through
        software and computer nerds) and takes advantage of our inherent visual
        systems to reach an understanding. It is a deliberate means of getting a
        message across, through a visual medium, in a way that ensures the
        message is fully comprehensible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Data visualizations, commonly in the form of graphs and charts, are used
        for analytical reasons. The data set, a complex collection of
        information, is represented in a way that is much more palatable through
        data vis. Not only is the information rendered easier to understand, but
        the data set can be used to ‘tell a story’. While the data set may have
        a myriad of possibilities when it comes to knowledge generation, the
        data visualization (in its limited capacity) shows the parts of that
        data that are deemed most necessary to achieve comprehension on a
        specific point.
      </p>
      <p class="quote">
        “We need to think more about the implications of what is shown within
        such graphics, and what remains missing”
      </p>
      <p>(Kidd, 2015)</p>
      <p>
        This brings us to the representation strategies of data vis. As Kidd
        posits in the aforementioned quote, data visualizations have an
        inherently reductive quality. The data vis, dependant on the data set,
        only shows what they want you to see. It is a manipulation of the data,
        and by extension a manipulation of the purveyor of the data vis, in
        order to attain full comprehension on the point of interest. Now said
        point of interest may just be the focus of the project at hand, but it
        could also be used pull the proverbial wool over peoples eyes, in an
        attempt to gain control of the system of knowledge generation, if not
        intentionally, then through the reductive nature of the system. The
        strategy of representation thus becomes a dangerous one, which must be
        manipulated with care, and whose dangerous by-products cannot be
        avoided.
      </p>
      <p class="sub">Data Art.</p>
      <p>
        If data visualization is a raincoat, data art is that same raincoat with
        a brand-name tagged on. A matter of form and function. While this
        analogy may be a bit reductive, as data vis is also designed with form
        in mind to a great extent, in data art, that form is aestheticized.
      </p>
      <p class="quote">
        “…artistic visualizations are visualizations of data done by artists
        with the intent of making art.”
      </p>
      <p>(Viégas, et al. 2007)</p>
      <p>
        Similar to data vis, data art begins with the humble data set. This data
        set, and the information stored within it, are used to make artistic
        visualizations which simultaneously represent the information, and
        (hopefully) enhance it in an artistic way. Unlike data vis which focuses
        on attaining an amplified cognition, or understanding of the
        information, data art focuses on representing the data in a novel
        manner. While originality is important in this (as in all other artistic
        endeavours) it must be considered that true creative spirit should
        manage to create that which is both novel and useful. Data vis errs on
        the side of useful and data art floats closer to the centre of this
        spectrum.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we assume data art to fall under the category of techno art (which is
        a safe assumption to make based on Roeser’s definitions (2018)) then we
        can conclude that techno art (and by extension data art) can help people
        make:
      </p>
      <p class="quote">
        “…abstract problems concrete, explore new scenarios, challenge their
        imaginations, and broaden their narrow personal perspectives through
        empathy, sympathy and compassion.”
      </p>
      <p>(Roeser, 2018)</p>
      <p>
        This now spills into the representational strategies of data art.
        Similar to data vis, data art can be assumed to fall prey to the same
        sort of reductive nature mentioned earlier, but its representational
        falls further into what Kidd (2015) would refer to as ‘persuasion’.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Kidd’s analysis of the relationship between representation and
        persuasion, the article breaks it down in terms of advertisements. Data
        art, I would argue (backed by Roeser’s emphasis on the use of emotions
        through art, a truism as far as I’m concerned) could, and probably would
        participate in a similar representational strategy of persuasion. By
        moulding the data set into something quite unrecognizable, and also
        aesthetically pleasing, the raw information is undeniably tempered. In
        the name of art, yes. In the name of amplifying cognition while pleasing
        the eye, yes. But tempered with, nonetheless. It not only reduces the
        data set to appear in a simpler form (like in the case of data vis) but
        also configures it in the name of art.
      </p>
      <p>
        While data art may not be celebrated for its analytical purposes in more
        serious circles, the ever-expanding reach of data art poses an
        ever-growing problem; how much will it sway people with art based on
        facts? What powers does it hold in terms of persuasion? And perhaps most
        importantly, is it possible to create data art, without resorting to
        these manipulative representational strategies?
