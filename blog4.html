      <p class="sub">INTRODUCTION</p>

      <p>
        The papers introduction provides the ‘call to action’ which drives the
        main question behind the paper. The call to action being to enrich
        interactivity in data visualization systems, in an attempt to give more
        freedom to end users in a variety of ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        This call to action, driven by the forward thinking of those in the data
        visualizations game, can immediately be seen as an important and highly
        necessary one. To ensure the best possible experience for those that are
        eventually going to use these systems (or any system) is a core facet of
        design. To, as a designer, shoulder on as much responsibility as
        possible, so that users are able to take full advantage of your designed
        systems when interacting with them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Naturally this type of system optimization does not come without
        difficulties. (Trust me, I know). Whether some of these challenges are
        technical in nature, a core challenge lies in the definition of
        interaction. While designers can see the need for it, it is difficult to
        implement unless an understanding is come to. An understanding which is
        impossible to achieve without starting with a definition. What is
        interaction in data visualization?
      </p>

      <p class="sub">REVIEWS & RATIONALES</p>
      <p>
        The next section of the paper, goes in depth on the methods the writers
        used when researching this paper, in an attempt to come to an answer to
        the question.
      </p>
      <p>
        This portion is very important academically, but it’s no Stephen King.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rest assured, all the research was done in a very methodological manner
        in order to ensure the best results.
      </p>
      <p class="sub">RESULTS</p>
      <p>
        The intensive research undertaken by the writers, helped them to find
        common similarities between the definitions for interaction, as found
        across some of the papers.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was then understood that there were certain mandatory components
        which would be necessary in order to define something as being
        interactive. These components are: External entities and actions, and
        Internal entities and actions.
      </p>
      <p class="sub">EXTERNAL ENTITIES</p>
      <p>
        Of the two most cited, are the user and the data. The user refers to the
        human being, equipped with the ability and motivation to interact with
        the system. (Dimara & Perin, 2020, p. 3).
      </p>
      <p>
        The data refers to “an intangible information source that is the user’s
        main object of interest.” (Dimara & Perin, 2020, p. 3).
      </p>
      <p>
        These first two building blocks of the definition are quite
        self-explanatory. Data visualization systems, are systems that attempt
        to visualize “intangible information” for a user equipped with
        sufficient “motivation” to peruse this data. These are the two external
        entities as they lay, ripe for interaction. The paper also mentions
        others such as time, but for this close reading I believe these two will
        suffice for now.
      </p>

      <p class="sub">INTERNAL ENTITIES</p>
      <p>Here the paper focuses on intent.</p>
      <p>
        “Interaction is characterized as a goal-oriented activity involving a
        data-oriented intent.” (Dimara & Perin, 2020, p. 3).
      </p>
      <p>
        Intention in interaction can range from a number of different ways that
        someone may use the data, for any number of reasons.
      </p>
      <p class="sub">EXTERNAL ACTIONS</p>
      <p>Here the paper describes the relationship of the interaction.</p>
      <p>
        It is a dialogue of sorts. The user performs an action, and the system
        provides an (appropriate) response to said action.
      </p>
      <p>
        The two external entities mentioned, the user and the data, partake in
        this relationship in order to warrant a definition of interaction. The
        user utilizes physical means of interaction, to prompt an appropriate
        and expected response from the system… if all went well.
      </p>
      <p class="sub">INTERNAL ACTIONS</p>
      <p>
        Besides the surface level means of interaction mentioned above, there is
        a deeper process being undertaken as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        The user interacts on a cognitive level with the data, and the data
        responds in a like manner, be it through a reasoning or analytic
        response.
      </p>
      <p>
        A similar action as its external counterpart, but on a more… profound
        level. (Normie plebs push buttons, Internal Actions understand on a
        deeper level)
      </p>
      <p class="sub">WHAT INTERACTION FOR VISUALZATION CAN INVOLVE</p>
      <p>
        Along with the afore mentioned entities and actions, specialized
        interaction for visualization can involve additional entities and
        actions.
      </p>
      <p>These additions are as follows:</p>
      <p>
        For External Entities, interaction can involve the physical real-world
        components of interaction, such as the physical tools (mouse, keyboard,
        etc.) as well as the physical appendages of the one who uses these tools
        (hands, eyes, etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
        The paper warns that overlooking or restricting these modalities can be
        detrimental to the system, implying that taking advantage of them will
        lead to better use of capturing user intent.
      </p>
      <p>
        For Internal Entities, the user is considered on a deeper level, taking
        into account any prior knowledge and experience they might have.
      </p>
      <p>
        For External Actions, the user actions that might change the data are
        taken into account. The physical changes are classified as the user
        manipulating the data to a specific end.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also considered is the dialogue between users and their peers. (“Hey
        Joe, seen the data last night?”)
      </p>
      <p>
        For Internal Actions, the fact that the user interacts with the data on
        a much deeper cognitive level is once again considered, albeit in a much
        deeper way.
      </p>

      <p class="sub">PROPERTIES OF INTERACTION</p>
      <p>
        The paper now provides three properties of interaction for your
        consideration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Granularity. Interactivity is described at multiple levels, from micro
        to macro and anything in between.
      </p>
      <p>
        Continuous and Discreet interactions. “Continuous interactions involve a
        sequence of intermediate visualization states between an initial state
        and a goal state” while “With discrete interactions, action and reaction
        occur in a distinct manner” (Dimara & Perin, 2020, p. 5)
      </p>

      <p class="sub">ACADEMICS</p>
      <p>
        The paper then goes on to give a variety of information, in an attempt
        to bring the reader to the definition we seek. As I am fast running out
        of word count, I will attempt to summarize the key points in the
        following sections, as I have identified them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first key point, being the way Visualization conceptualizes
        interaction. It does this in a three-pronged approach. System, Task, and
        Human.
      </p>
      <p>
        System approaches, focus on the system, through the use of skilled
        operators. At this level, there is no clarification of
        user/user-intentions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Task-centric approaches, focus on interactions in terms of low-level
        tasks, distinguishing between data types, and user roles.
      </p>
      <p>Human-centric approaches, focus on user intent on a deeper level.</p>
      <p>
        The paper then attempts to find similarities and differences in
        interaction in visualization and interaction in HCI (Human-Computer
        Interaction).
      </p>
      <p>
        This begins with some concepts that characterize interactions in HCI.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having come to an understanding of HCI interaction, the paper now uses
        this to extend the view of visualization through the lens of HCI.
      </p>
      <p>
        It does this first in terms of user intent. In HCI, user intent is not
        specifically considered. Rather there are general tools provided to the
        user, in order to achieve any number of tasks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Data visualization, is naturally more focused than this. User intent
        plays a large role, and has to be considered in order to provide the
        best possible tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second extension comes in terms of user profiling. In HCI the user
        is assumed to be… a human. No other assumption is made, and the
        interactions provided reflect that. Broader means of interaction,
        offered to a broader possibility of interactor.
      </p>
      <p>
        In data visualization, once again the user is considered with much more
        specificity. The population of interactors is much more expertly catered
        to.
      </p>
      <p>
        The paper then goes on to define some differences between HCI and the
        topic of discussion.
      </p>

      <p class="sub">CONCLUSION</p>
      <p>The paper eventually comes to an answer to the proposed question.</p>
      <p class="quote">
        “Interaction for visualization is the interplay between a person and a
        data interface involving a data-related intent, at least one action from
        the person and an interface reaction that is perceived as such.”
      </p>
      <p>(Dimara & Perin, 2020, p. 8)</p>
      <p>
        This definition is quite self-explanatory, but I will break it down as
        succinctly as possible.
      </p>
      <p class="quote">Interplay</p>
      <p>
        This refers to the actions undertaken between the two main external
        entities discovered above, the user and the data.
      </p>
      <p class="quote">Intent</p>
      <p>
        The user, as previously mentioned, has an intent when approaching the
        data.
      </p>
      <p class="quote">At least one action</p>
      <p>
        Semantics. In order for interaction to occur, there has to be a minimum
        of one action on the part of the user.
      </p>
      <p class="quote">Reaction that is perceived as such</p>
      <p>
        An appropriate reaction to the user’s action, that is identifiable as a
        reaction.
